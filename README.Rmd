```

Make week number object from year and week:

```{r make_weeknumber}

make_weeknumber(2019:2020, 53)
```

Get year and week number from an object:

```{r year_week}
x <- as.weeknumber(c(-1:1, 51:52, NA))
year_week(x)
```

Print a tibble:

```{r tibble}
set.seed(0)
library(tibble)
d <- tibble(
  x = seq(as.weeknumber("2000-W01"), as.weeknumber("2000-W09")),
  y = cumsum(rnorm(length(x)))
)
print(d)
```

Plot with week number scale:

```{r plot}
library(ggplot2)
